[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/35ce88da8b794d9d9e5369ea785853d8)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Zubs/MyChart?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Zubs/MyChart&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

The charts in the page where made with chart.js, a JavaScript library for data visualizations, and are written in PHP files so they may be copied and re-used independently. These are ready-to-go code snippets you can use in your applications to make very amazing visuals.
